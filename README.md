# Share&Nurture Posting App

This is the Posting App for the Share&Nurture Team at Isha Foundation. 

The application is used for creating a posting schedule and is a platform for a Team of Volunteers, which are posting content related to Yoga on Facebook groups.

## Basic characteristics

- written in Google Apps Script (JavaScript)
- Object-Oriented structure
- Many custom functions in UI (Isha Tools tab, see examples below)
- API calls to the Bitly API for generating Bitly links (UrlFetchApp.fetch())
- Spreadsheet project properties managment
- Managing spreadsheet access
- Creating sheets from a template with values provided by user
- Manipulating cells with values provided by user
- Automatically updating values in different sheets when specific information is provided (example #1 below)
- Posting schedule creation includes business logic (f.e. using backup content if ads are not allowed in the Fb group)

## Examples

### #1 sharing a FB post between two sheets
Once the primary volunteer puts the link to the Facebook post, it gets automatically shared with the secondary volunteer.

### #2 creating a Bitly link from a Youtube link with Bitly API
  - Custom UTM parameters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46DnVgHD_FM/?utm_source=Best%20series%20on%20Netflix&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=poleng&utm_content=Most%20watched%20series%20on%20Netflix
  - UTM parameters are later used by a different application for tracking which groups/contents are best by calling the Bitly API for click count.
